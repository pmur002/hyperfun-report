+ Report on the 'hyperfun' package

+ Nice silly "stochastic" example:

  A dice with dots located (semi)randomly on each face

  See ThreeD/Testing/dice.hf for normal dice that provides
  good examples of constructive geometry "subtraction" AND "negation"!

+ See ../../ThreeD/Testing/test.R for some examples,
  including examples of hfR()

+ NOTE that can still hand write HyperFun code directly !

+ Applications to drawing 3D diagrams to explain statistical concepts ???

  (cut slices from 3D probability densities ???)


+ Copyright issues

+ The package C/C++ code is used to build two stand-alone programs:  

  hfp, which behaves much like the original HyperFun command line tool (minus
       the GLUT display and interactivity).

  hfp-client, which expects a socket connection to connect to and to
              communicate on, either to signal complete (by sending "0") 
              or to request a function value (by sending a function index
              and x/y/z values, e.g., "1 -10 -10 -10" and then receiving
              a string containing a numeric value in return).
